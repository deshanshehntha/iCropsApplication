An original taste of Hawaii from Chef Sam Choy. Microwaveable. Growing up in Hawaii, amidst varied cultures, my mother and father introduced me to a variety of tastes. Being amazing cooks themselves, they had a real appreciation for a variety of foods and styles of presentation. My father is of Chinese descent, and although he was born and raised in Hawaii, he continued to cook traditional Chinese dishes. My mother, who was Hawaiian and German, could whip up all the local style meals, along with European fare. Combine the two, and you have me. What they taught me about food and cooking has been very valuable. They loved to cook; they cooked from the heart. The rigors of modern life have forced people to miss out on really good, homestyle meals. That's why I was inspired to create this recipe for Chef's Originals. You don't have to go to a lot of trouble to create a delicious meal. My Shiitake Mushroom Rice is flavored with a savory mix of mushrooms, soy sauce and molasses. Shiitake mushrooms make this dish a real treat. Try all my Hawaiian dishes, and remember, cook from the heart! Tips from Chef Sam's Kitchen: My favorite way of eating this rice is just plain. However, if you want a heartier meal, add some fresh fish, pork, stir-fried chicken and other types of fresh mushrooms.

Most commonly known as porcini (from the plural of its Italian name porcino), it has a number of common names, including cep (from its Catalan name cep or its French name cpe, although the latter is a generic term applying to several species), king bolete and penny bun.\n\nThe fruiting body is a large imposing mushroom the cap of which may reach 25 cm (10 in) in diameter and 1 kg (2.2 lb) in weight. Symbiotic, it forms an ectomycorrhizal association with pine and is found in pine forests and plantations in autumn.\n\nHighly prized, Boletus edulis is commercially sold fresh in autumn in central and southern Europe but is also dried and distributed worldwide.\n\nAs the name implies, Boletus edulis is edible, and a polled sample of people consider it superior to most other porcini in flavor and in texture.It is described as nutty and slightly meaty, with a smooth, creamy texture. This mushroom has a distinct aroma reminiscent of sourdough. It has a higher water content than other edible mushrooms. When dried, Boletus edulis has more protein than all other commonly consumed vegetables apart from soybeans. Porcini are eaten and enjoyed many ways, sauted with butter, ground into pasta, in risotto, in soups, and in many other dishes. They are a feature of many cuisines. The addition of a few pieces of porcini can significantly add to flavor of soups, stews etc..

Enter preserved truffles. Best for used in hot dishes like risottos, omelets and mashed potatoes. The heat of the dish itself will help bring out the aromas. An even more successful way to enhance the dish would be to add as well some truffle oil, butter or truffle paste (oils and butters are usually more aromatic than canned truffles, and can preserve the fragrance of the dish longer). Preserved truffles are a nice, budget-friendly way to add visual truffle appeal to dishes. However, if you are looking to add the pungent aroma and taste of truffles to your dish, we recommend that you explore our fresh truffle selection. Jarred or canned truffles, sold by us or any other vendor, are mere shadows of their fresh truffle selves and will not, by themselves, deliver the aroma or flavor of fresh truffles. They are great to use with truffle oil the oil will add the flavor, the preserved truffles the truffle look, but preserved truffles should be used only to garnish a dish, or in conjunction to truffle butter and oil during those times when fresh truffles are out of season or when the budget doesn't allow for the real thing.

When the fresh truffle season ends (yes, a dark day indeed in kitchens around the world), we're thankful that there is an alternative to get our truffle fix. Enter preserved truffles. Summer truffles will not be very striking out of the jar, and will need to be heated up or cooked with to bring out the flavors. Best for used in hot dishes like risottos, omelets and mashed potatoes. The heat of the dish itself will help bring out the aroma. An even more successful way to enhance the dish would be to add as well some truffle oil, butter or truffle paste (oils and butters are usually more aromatic than canned truffles, and can preserve the fragrance of the dish longer).Preserved truffles are a nice, budget-friendly way to add visual truffle appeal to dishes. Jarred or canned truffles, sold by us or any other vendor, are mere shadows of their fresh truffle selves and will not, by themselves, deliver the aroma or flavor of fresh truffles. They are great to use with truffle oil  the oil will add the flavor, the preserved truffles the truffle look, but preserved truffles should be used only to garnish a dish, or in conjunction to truffle butter and oil during those times when fresh truffles are out of season or when the budget doesnt allow for the real thing. Preserved truffles out of the jar or can have almost no flavor or odor. If youre looking to add a truffle appearance to your dish, then this is the product for you, as the excellent texture, rigidity and wholeness of our preserved truffles will give any dish a truffle look.

The seaweed is harvested at a depth of about 25 feet, washed, processed, and spread thin on special racks to dry. Once pressed, the Nori is then roasted to enhance its flavor and texture, turning into a brilliant green color.\n\nNori seaweed draws an extraordinary wealth of mineral elements from the sea that can account for up to 36% of its dry mass. These nutrients include sodium, magnesium, potassium, iodine, zinc, Beta carotene, vitamin A, vitamin B complex, vitamin C, and calcium, just to name a few. In addition to vitamins and minerals, Nori is also high in fiber and protein and low in carbohydrates. It provides up to ten times more calcium and iron by weight than dairy products.

126313,"['Grocery & Gourmet Food', 'Produce', 'Fresh Vegetables', 'Mushrooms & Truffles']",,"['Maitake is a mushroom found growing wild in Japan and in forests in the eastern part of North America, where it grows on dying or already dead hardwood trees. The word maitake means dancing mushroom in Japanese; the mushroom was given this name because people were supposed to have danced for joy when they found it. It is also called hen-in-the woods some can reach the size of beach balls and larger. Because maitake comes from the Polypores group, it produces a bunch of leaf-like clumps that are intertwined. During Japans feudal era, maitake was used as currency; the daimyo, or provincial nobles, would exchange maitake for its weight in silver from the shogun, the military ruler of Japan.\n\nAlthough the Chinese and Japanese have used maitake in cooking and healing for centuries, it is only in the last 20 years that studies have been conducted concerning its functions. Maitakes main functions are activating the immune system and acting as an antitumor agent. Maitake is known as an adaptogen and tonic, and as such it aids healthy people to keep their levels of blood sugar, blood pressure, cholesterol, and weight normal. The beta glucan in maitake is a cell-surface carbohydrate. This means beta glucan aids cell communication in specific circumstances. As a polysaccharide, this glucan activates the white blood cells, called macrophages, which in turn devour microorganisms that produce disease, as well as tumors.\n\nWith this kit we will teach you how to grow maitake on logs\n\nWe Provide:\n\nWe provide mushroom information booklet, Instructions, and Recipes on how to inoculate your logs / stump, and Wax for sealing the holes. \n\nItems you will need to provide: Power Drill, and a 5/16"" Drill Bit, and a fresh hardwood log / Stump. \n\nNOTE: This kit will do 1 log 40"" long and 3-8"" in diameter, or 1 large stump.', 'Statements regarding dietary supplements have not been evaluated by the FDA and are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease or health condition.']",,Maitake Mushroom Growing Log Kit,[],,Vista Mushrooms,[],"864,814 in Grocery & Gourmet Food (",[],Grocery,,,,B00ALNNSLO,['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51BlztRePBL._SS40_.jpg'],['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51BlztRePBL.jpg'],"{'Shipping Weight:': '6.1 ounces', 'ASIN: ': 'B00ALNNSLO', 'UPC:': '609207633587', 'Item model number:': 'AL1004'}",Grocery & Gourmet FoodProduceFresh VegetablesMushrooms & Truffles

It is highly valued for its culinary uses. Summer truffles do not have as strong an aroma or taste as winter truffles do. They are mainly harvested from June to November . These truffles grow in symbiosis with trees such as oaks, hazels and beech. Their shape is generally round, up to 4 cm diameter. This truffle had a mouthwatering sweetness that some have described as chocolaty. Do not cook it, shave it onto your dish after cooking. Right before serving the dish. White or black paper-thin truffle slices may be inserted into meats, under the skins of roasted fowl, in foie gras preparations, in pates, or in stuffings. Some speciality cheeses contain truffles as well. The flavour of black truffles is far less pungent and more refined than that of white truffles. It is reminiscent of fresh earth and mushrooms, and when fresh, their scent fills a room almost instantly. In 2006, designer Tom Ford released a perfume that lists black truffle as its first note.While in the past chefs used to peel truffles, in modern times most restaurants brush the truffle carefully and shave it or dice it with the skin on so as to use most of this expensive ingredient.', 'Statements regarding dietary supplements have not been evaluated by the FDA and are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease or health condition.']",,Fresh Black Summer Truffles,[],,Oregon Mushrooms,[],"1,263,455 in Grocery & Gourmet Food (",[],Grocery,,,,B00ARMGLFE,[],[],"{'Shipping Weight:': '1 pounds', 'ASIN: ': 'B00ARMGLFE'}",Grocery & Gourmet FoodProduceFresh VegetablesMushrooms & TrufflesBlack Truffles

The Truffle Caviar is made from the black winter truffle juice, which is obtained directly from the fresh truffle during the cooking. The tasty juice is then reduced in small pearls through a very sophisticated technique called ""sferification"". These pearls have the taste of the truffle but the same color and texture of the caviar. The Perlage di tartufo (Truffle Perlage) is a new product of Tartuflanghe, which was the grand prix award winner for best innovative product of 2010 by SIAL groups observatory for trends, innovations and tendances. The company founders, Domenica and Beppe, began business in the world of the truffle in 1968, selling fresh truffles from Piedmont. During those years, their restaurant Da Beppe, in the heart of Alba town, was designated by the Michelin guide as a reference point for lovers of cooking based on mushrooms and truffles.\n\nTartuflanghe was founded in 1980 in order to profit from Beppes inspiration and culinary experience which had matured following a prestigious career: Head Chef aboard cruise ships from 1958  1966, teacher in a catering school, chef in the most well known restaurants of Piedmontese cuisine and then owner of his famous restaurant.The first truffle specialities were created to give aficionados the opportunity to enjoy good cooking and also truffles out of season. Thanks to this policy the kitchen laboratories of Tartuflanghe produced the first truffle pasta product in the world (awarded best new product of the year prize in 1992 at the Fancy Food Summer Show in New York). After tagliolini pasta with truffle came prepared risotto, polenta and fonduta with truffle. Beppes traditional, very authentic Piedmontese recipes have enabled the company to become established in the specialized high quality gastronomic product market right from the start.Tartuflanghe today is to be found in the most prestigious gourmet shops.', 'Statements regarding dietary supplements have not been evaluated by the FDA and are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease or health condition.']",,Tartuflanghe (2 pack) Truffle Caviar Perlage Black 50g From Italy,[],,TartufLanghe,[],"444,348 in Grocery & Gourmet Food (","['B00O29ONEE', 'B007VH0RLC']",Grocery,,,$61.00,B00D93SDDQ,[],[],"{'Shipping Weight:': '1 pounds (', 'ASIN: ': 'B00D93SDDQ', 'UPC:': '827649075325'}",Grocery & Gourmet FoodProduceFresh VegetablesMushrooms & TrufflesBlack Truffles

The Truffle Caviar is made from the black winter truffle juice, which is obtained directly from the fresh truffle during the cooking. The tasty juice is then reduced in small pearls through a very sophisticated technique called ""sferification"". These pearls have the taste of the truffle but the same color and texture of the caviar. The Perlage di tartufo (Truffle Perlage) is a new product of Tartuflanghe, which was the grand prix award winner for best innovative product of 2010 by SIAL groups observatory for trends, innovations and tendances. The company founders, Domenica and Beppe, began business in the world of the truffle in 1968, selling fresh truffles from Piedmont. During those years, their restaurant Da Beppe, in the heart of Alba town, was designated by the Michelin guide as a reference point for lovers of cooking based on mushrooms and truffles.\n\nTartuflanghe was founded in 1980 in order to profit from Beppes inspiration and culinary experience which had matured following a prestigious career: Head Chef aboard cruise ships from 1958  1966, teacher in a catering school, chef in the most well known restaurants of Piedmontese cuisine and then owner of his famous restaurant.The first truffle specialities were created to give aficionados the opportunity to enjoy good cooking and also truffles out of season. Thanks to this policy the kitchen laboratories of Tartuflanghe produced the first truffle pasta product in the world (awarded best new product of the year prize in 1992 at the Fancy Food Summer Show in New York). After tagliolini pasta with truffle came prepared risotto, polenta and fonduta with truffle. Beppes traditional, very authentic Piedmontese recipes have enabled the company to become established in the specialized high quality gastronomic product market right from the start.Tartuflanghe today is to be found in the most prestigious gourmet shops.', 'Statements regarding dietary supplements have not been evaluated by the FDA and are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease or health condition.']",,Tartuflanghe Truffle Caviar Perlage Black 340g From Italy,[],,TartufLanghe,[],"641,419 in Grocery & Gourmet Food (","['B017TBR2XK', 'B007VH0RLC', 'B004HJFK78', 'B00DEP3FC8', 'B00WT2M70S', 'B00D93SDDQ', 'B01A9IJ6LQ', 'B000HDJZEM', 'B01LYTWLFH', 'B0057ARVI2']",Grocery,,,,B00E7TRUUI,[],[],"{'\n    Item Weight: \n    ': '12 ounces', 'Shipping Weight:': '5 pounds', 'ASIN: ': 'B00E7TRUUI'}",Grocery & Gourmet FoodProduceFresh VegetablesMushrooms & TrufflesBlack Truffles

The tubers are elongated and uneven, typically 7.5-10 centimetres (3.0-3.9 in) long and 3-5 centimetres (1.2-2.0 in) thick, and vaguely resembling ginger root, with a crisp texture when raw. They vary in color from pale brown to white, red, or purple.[2][4] The artichoke contains about 10% protein, no oil, and a surprising lack of starch The tubers are sometimes used as a substitute for potatoes:they have a similar consistency, and in their raw form have a similar texture, but a sweeter, nuttier flavor; raw and sliced thinly, they are fit for a salad. In Baden-Wrttemberg, Germany, over 90% of the Jerusalem artichoke crop is used to produce a spirit called ""Topinambur"", ""Topi"" or ""Rossler"".[13] By the end of the 19th-century Jerusalem artichokes were being used in Baden to make a spirit called ""Jerusalem artichoke brandy,"" ""Jerusalem artichoke"", ""Topi"", ""Erdpfler"" ""Rossler"" or ""Borbel.""', 'Statements regarding dietary supplements have not been evaluated by the FDA and are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease or health condition.']",,"Jerusalem Artichoke, variety Stampede - Helianthus Tuberosus - 1.5 pounds - Organic",[],,Yumheart Gardens,[],"342,834 in Grocery & Gourmet Food (","['B003VX1L1K', 'B00QVRQ1U4', 'B0716BJ187', 'B015062W4A', 'B01A26MHIY']",Grocery,,,,B00EWNPDVC,[],[],"{'Shipping Weight:': '3 pounds', 'ASIN: ': 'B00EWNPDVC', 'Item model number:': 'stamp1'}",Grocery & Gourmet FoodProduceFresh Vegetables

This Irish Moss is wild-crafted, harvested fresh from the ocean. It needs to be washed and soaked before use. Directions for use: Rinse and soak well at least three times. The sea smell will go away with soaking. Give the Irish Moss a loving rub to remove salt and other ocean debris such as sand (small colored fibers might be left over from the nets used to harvesting). Put Irish Moss is a tall container (it will double in size) and fill with fresh water. Soak for 24 to 48 hours. Remember to change the water twice a day. While changing the water rub the Irish Moss to loosen more debris. Rinse one final time and place in blender. Process the Irish Moss until you get a smooth consistency. You might need to add additional water. Take care to scrape down the sides of the blender to ensure that there are no pieces of Irish Moss. Keep the gel in an airtight container in the fridge for up to two weeks. Add to recipes for emollient and gelatinous effect. Contrary to logic, Irish Moss gets a very sweet smell when it goes bad. Net wt.: 16 oz Chef Tip: Wash and soak 4 to 8 oz of Irish Moss at one time. Blend the Irish Moss to a smooth gel. Use silicon ice cube trays to freeze the gel. Store the frozen cubes in the freezer in an air tight container or zip-lock bag. Using this method ensures that you always have Irish Moss ready to make great foods and desserts.

These fine slices of black truffle immersed in olive oil have a long shelf life even after opening. This recipe was mastered by Paolo Cerutti of Casa del Tartufo, the authentic family business in Alba, Italy. One of Cerutti's secrets is to slice and pickle the truffles while they are fresh and firm, saving the truffle's rich earthy flavor for your delight.\nIn Your Kitchen\nBlack Truffle Slices Preserve can be used in the same dishes as fresh truffles. They will turn eggs, pasta, risotto, sandwiches, etc., into gourmet meals. It is important not to overheat the truffles as they will lose their delicate flavor. You can also use the olive oil from the truffle jar, as it is infused with truffle aromas."", ""Albal's Black Truffles (Tuber Aestivum Vitt)"", ""Recipe Suggestions\nAdd 1-2 truffle slices to a cracker with brie;\nAdd truffle slices to your favorite omelet toward the end of its preparation. Drizzle some olive oil from the same jar over the finished dish;\nAdd truffle slices to risotto or pasta;\nWhite lasagna truffle, add slices of truffle on the heart and last to the top layer of the lasagna.\nTruffle mush potatoes, add slices of truffle toward the end of mixing the potatoes. Drizzle some olive oil from the same jar over the finished dish.\nThe crazy idea - Truffle Burger: the secret is to add truffle slices timely and in the right amount. Cover the meat with a layer of truffle slices as it is about ready and add cheese on top until it melts and covers the truffles. This will intensify the flavor. You can place a couple of truffle slices on top for decoration, but the finest taste will concentrate in the heart of the burger.\n Storage\nAfter opening, it is best to refrigerate the Black Truffle Slices Preserve and consume the product within one month. If the oil thickens, don't worry - it will thaw at room temperature. \n\nWine Pairing\nLight appetizers with truffles are best with white wines such as Arneis, Gavi or Pinot Grigio. Also delightful are sparkling wines such as Franciacorta, Prosecco or Metodo Classico.\nOmelets and truffles pair ideally with brunch drinks such as a mimosa with Prosecco, or a light red wine such as Dolcetto or Barbera. \nPasta, risotto, lasagna & mush potatoes are perfectly pair to red wines such Dolcetto, Barbera, Barolo, Cabernet, red Napa blend. \n\nIf you are having a burger with sliced truffles, try it with a cold beer.

To make good kombu the freshly harvested kombu has to be sun-dried the same day. The dried kombu then is cut into smaller pieces and folded, so that it can be transported to the Okui warehouse. When the dried kombu arrives at the warehouse is it wrapped in a cloth that protects it from mold and dust, but allows a slow fermentation. The kombu then ages between one and three years to develop the umami, which gives soups and dashi broth a deep aroma. Similar to wine to it requires a lot of expertise and highly controlled conditions to let kombu age and improve over many years. Nowadays there only are few companies left that understand this art.

Our Porcini come from the Balkan Mountains famous for its particular climatic and natural conditions benefiting mushroom production. The high temperatures combined with constant and copious showers and very high humidity microclimate has explosive effects on the fungal blooms. Our Porcini are born under the oaks of this flourishing mountain region. They are picked at the altitude of 300-600 meters. We only dry special kind of Porcini mushrooms - ""boletus aereus"" (mushroom with a black head). This kind of Porcini mushroom is aromatic, fibrous. Selection process and cleaning criteria Upon arrival mushrooms are selected in refrigerated areas of our plants. They are divided into grades, in time of aging, in percentage of holes, in sizes, color of the head and their origin areas. After the first selection, our staff clean mushrooms, by removing any hand-ground stems with a knife and brushing over the head and with a damp sponge to remove all the residual impurities. Only ideal mushrooms that have reached a precise ripeness are selected to be cut into slices for natural drying. When mushroom is dried it has to pass a check for impurities, to remove everything that is not perfect.

We recommend using grain spawn within one to three months of purchase. Most species must be stored refrigerated. Spawn is simply a carrier to hold a specific strain of mushroom mycelium in stasis until you, the cultivator, are ready to transfer it into another substrate such as a wood log, straw, compost etc. We incubate specialty mushroom strains in our laboratory, then cultivate them into a variety of forms for your use, including sawdust, grain, and dowel plugs. Each of these, once colonized by mycelium, is referred to as spawn. We also sell the other types of spawn here as well. This grain is ready to go, just mix it with straw, paper, coffee grounds, wood chips, yard waste etc. The Phoenix oyster has a complex, earthy flavor and delicate, slightly chewy texture.

LOGS MUST GO THROUGH INCUBATION PROCESS GENERALLY #_^ MONTHS> Glowing Mushroom Log: FREE USA SHIPPING The Glowing Mushroom Panellus Stipticus is a basidiomycete that grows on wood and produces fruiting bodies similar to oyster mushrooms (Pleurotus spp.). This is one of the brightest glowing fungi that can be seen with the naked eye. It glows best when cultivated on oak logs like this one. Many species are luminescent, but most are only visible under a microscope or in very low-light conditions. The primordial pins and mushrooms themselves glow very brightly and can be easily observed in less than complete darkness. You will be amazed and delighted by this treat! This is NOT a human-altered species. It is 100% Mother Nature. Note: Luminescent mushrooms  unlike man-made luminescence  is not triggered by light. They actually glow 24-hours per day. It is just not possible for humans to see them glowing in the light of day. The Panellus Stipticus needs to be kept in a dapple shaded and moist environment, without drying or exposure to excessively cool/hot temps and windy areas. Your log will generally fruit/colonize in temperatures between 65-80F. Once your log has begun to fruit, you can move it wherever you would like in your habitats, or yard for prime viewing. Buy several and use them to line your driveway or surround a deck for a party or to create paths for romantic night time strolls.

It&apos;s very easy to do. You just drill holes for your plugs pound them in, water and wait! By doing this mushroom mycelium is encouraged to grow throughout and completely Colonize the wood. Once your log has been fully colonized, A process that usually takes 6-12 months, mushrooms will begin to spring forth from the cracks or channels in the wood. Giving you mushrooms for years and years! It is best to inoculate your logs and stumps Any time from early spring up to about 2-3 weeks before consistently freezing temperatures set in. Basically you need to allow a few weeks for the mushroom mycelium to establish itself in its new home before it goes dormant for the winter. The Logs can be left outdoors over the Winter, under a layer of straw, Some mulch, or a burlap tarp, shade cloth or other vapor-permeable cover. A shed, barn, garage or other outbuilding will do fine. Mushrooms prefer to grow on hardwood. Non-aromatic hardwoods such as oak, elm, maple, Alder and similar woods are very good candidates for log cultivation. Logs should be cut a few months before you begin plugging. Cut your logs in lengths of 3-4 feet. Use a 5/16&quot; drill bit to drill 2-inch holes2 to 4 inches apart, evenly spaced. Insert 1 plug per hole and whack it in with a hammer. A 3-4 foot log can take about 50 plugs, while stumps usually hold 30-50 plugs. The more plugs you use, the faster your log will be colonized with mushroom mycelium.

The flavor is closer to a roasted bell pepper than a chili pepper, and the complex taste of the piquillo pepper is unmatched. Serve them drizzled with olive oil and grated cheese, or add a burst of flavor to everyday dishes such as salads, omelets and sandwiches. An iconic Spanish food, piquillo peppers come from a small area near Navarra in the north of Spain. Piquillo means 'little beaks' and the peppers unique triangular shape makes them ideal for stuffing. Only the ripe, bright red peppers are picked and then fire-roasted until they are slightly charred on the outside. During the fire-roasting process, much of the water in the pepper cooks away, intensifying the incredible flavor. The charred piquillo peppers are peeled by hand and tucked into bottles filled with nothing but their own flavorful juices - allowing their radiant flavor to truly shine. The exclusive brand of La Tienda, our Peregrino products reflect the best of Spanish cuisine and traditions.

These mushrooms can also be grown indoors if you choose to do so. By growing your own mushrooms naturally on hardwood logs you can reap all of the nutritional and medicinal benefits the mushrooms have to offer. Unlike our competitors we offer high quality oak logs that are inoculated with our own handmade first generation mushroom spawn. We do not purchase our spawn from other companies like most of our competitors. We also cut our logs during the winter season insuring high moisture levels and high nutrient rich logs, and our logs contain large sapwood to heartwood portions for maximum log production. Mushrooms cost a fortune in the store and are full of pesticides used to keep fruit flies and bugs out of the mass production growing chambers where 80% of all mushrooms are grown on hardwood supplemented sawdust blocks in the United States, and we all know eating mushrooms youve grown yourself and harvested five minutes ago from a real log is hands down healthier, and much cheaper than store bought mushrooms over time. We work with tree clearing companies and harvest the top limb portions they leave behind from the harvested trees, we believe in recycling what would normally be left to just rot on the ground. The top portion of the trees yield the best logs for mushroom cultivation anyway due to the fact that the limbs contain almost 100% sapwood, the sapwood is what determines how long your log will grow mushrooms, basically the sapwood is the mushrooms food source for the mushrooms and also determines the life of the log, the more sapwood the more food, when the mushroom mycelium consumes all the nutrients in the sapwood the log doesnt grow mushrooms anymore. Your log will last 2-4 years. After the first fruiting it will fruit naturally 4-5 times a year or you can force it to grow every two months.', 'Statements regarding dietary supplements have not been evaluated by the FDA and are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease or health condition.']",,Forest Organics Wood Ear Mushroom Growing Log Pre-Inoculated,[],,Forest Organics,[],"1,027,583 in Grocery & Gourmet Food (",[],Grocery,,,,B00XZSLNDC,"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41NjQDeYoAL._SS40_.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41naAH5rYtL._SS40_.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/511OxKBI36L._SS40_.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/618jY1LW1bL._SS40_.jpg']","['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41NjQDeYoAL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41naAH5rYtL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/511OxKBI36L.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/618jY1LW1bL.jpg']","{'\n    Item Weight: \n    ': '5 pounds', 'Shipping Weight:': '6 pounds', 'ASIN: ': 'B00XZSLNDC', 'UPC:': '641752986862'}",Grocery & Gourmet FoodProduceFresh VegetablesMushrooms & Truffles

Use it the same as fresh or other dried mushrooms in stir fries, soups, gravies, and marinara sauce. Rich in vitamin D and niacin B3. A great source of fiber.<br/> For the table, Maitake may be the most versatile mushroom of all. It has a unique, truly excellent flavor that neither overpowers nor is easily overpowered. I think it has a slightly astringent edge. It is great saut?ed, deep-fried, microwaved, boiled, and dried. I love this one! It has a really pleasant, crunchy, very chewable texture all the way down the stem. A moderately thick batter is best for deep frying maitake. Their coloring is deep, creating colors of coral, cinnamon and rust. Their flesh is granular and brittle. Lobster mushrooms make a great dried mushroom as the drying process captures their rich flavor qualities and preserves them.<br/> The dried mushroom powder can be used to add flavor to meatloaf, pasta sauce, gravy, b?chamel based sauces, etc. You can use a lot because the powder has a subtle flavor. Go nuts with this one! It also makes a pleasant medicinal tea."", 'To rehydrate or reconstitute dried mushrooms, place desired amount into a bowl covered with warm water and let dried mushrooms soak for 30 minutes.

HOW IT TASTES: exactly how youd imagine the freshest garlic, basil, rosemary, thyme, oregano, cilantro and lemongrass would taste: pungent, earthy, fragrant, woodsy, spicy, floral, and citrusy, but likely better than youve ever tasted. And weve removed the unpleasant textures of some whole herbs, so you can focus on just clean, pure flavor. HOW IT'S USED: youll use Spray-On Herbs in such a life-changing way, youll hardly ever miss fresh herbs again. Our herb extracts are flavor-packed, so you can start with just a little, and add more later for extra intensity. Just a quick drizzle or spritz, before, during, or after cooking, and youll be amazed at how elevated and customized your everyday dishes will be.

Alaria is the most delicate of the brown seaweeds. It can be used to create a Miso soup with a wild, yet delicate flavor. Alaria, as with many sea vegetables, contains many of the vitamins and minerals needed to live a healthy life. Nutritional Values: Alaria (alaria esculenta) has one of the highest sources of calcium. It is rich in B complex vitamins, vitamins A, C, and K. High in protein , iron, magnesium, iodine, sodium, chromium, zinc, phosphorus, potassium, and dietary fiber. Alaria is almost identical to Japanese wakame biologically and nutritionally. Culinary Uses: Alaria is excellent for Miso soup and makes calcium rich vegetable soups, and stews. It imparts a chicken-like flavor when cooked with rice. Whole leaf alaria can be used uncooked in salads if pre-soaked, marinated in lemon juice, blanched or steamed. It can also be quick roasted and enjoyed as 'chips'. Alaria has more delicate taste but needs a longer cooking time (40 minutes) than the cultivated Japanese wakame (15 minutes). Soak prior to cooking and use the soaking water. Powdered Alaria is a great addition to any energy or protein drink that needs mineral fortification (particularly calcium)."", 'Statements regarding dietary supplements have not been evaluated by the FDA and are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease or health condition.']",,VitaminSea Organic Wakame Seaweed Alaria - 4 oz Whole Leaf Maine Coast - USDA &amp; Vegan Certified - Kosher - Perfect For Keto &amp; Paleo Diets - Sun Dried Raw Wild Atlantic Ocean Sea Vegetables (WW4),"['B018KIJ9Z0', 'B018KIJ9YQ', 'B018JJTYUU', 'B01ELOUC30', 'B075WSS9P8', 'B005P0WOZE', 'B00IBNZAEE', 'B01ELNW4DM', 'B001AS975U', 'B001BKNFSC', 'B00D3ZDVO6', 'B0052BGLMS', 'B00I01ZXYE', 'B00FBSST9K', 'B000UWE0AO', 'B001KWD1BM', 'B01M1RM6YA', 'B001216DLG', 'B001BKTH70', 'B00LC01Z5G', 'B002HQSNCW', 'B0071GWMA2', 'B00ZB13JHO', 'B004XIS14M', 'B07G6GD3M1', 'B01LXWXCBD', 'B001HTKNEQ', 'B00EHQEI6U', 'B008ZRYXAI', 'B004NR24YG', 'B006H3BF26', 'B00I33D544', 'B078SKL3SZ', 'B0019JRLC6', 'B00L9Z8YMG', 'B00NO9I6VO', 'B0019JTH82', 'B01MD1D64A', 'B076J8CSW4', 'B00013VAXM', 'B002FON43O', 'B002EUZEVY', 'B01GGWBIPG', 'B00028QCD4', 'B07DTDFGWH', 'B005763K40', 'B07G4LXPC7', 'B001AS886O', 'B078DDTSP8', 'B0013JRTQK', 'B01IC89JJ4', 'B0013JLOHA', 'B00B7CTDPS', 'B01HH79Y0U', 'B01N0I6ZGZ', 'B007A2XKPI', 'B07DNQTX22', 'B00856TSCC', 'B001PEWJWC', 'B0002YB40O', 'B00QKXVAN2', 'B002DY1EJC', 'B00PJ543H2', 'B01EM0NSIO', 'B001214Q1U', 'B00YQ2YNME', 'B079FFQVBF', 'B01BLYNWVM', 'B0039ITKR4', 'B079FDTZBP', 'B00060P9XM', 'B00KYWHCXW', 'B00PJ3IPMI', 'B00VVN02P8', 'B07F93F75W', 'B01N8PAXX3', 'B00FEPUNUS', 'B0000CNU0C', 'B014VGMLCI', 'B0111LK0X8', 'B00PFI00PC', 'B0019JNRI8', 'B00SSC8ID8', 'B01M0ILFLB', 'B00TWUJQIG', 'B00IBNAW24', 'B01L2TGOEI', 'B0007SMLUM', 'B00CQ7K5QO', 'B072MK5TTK', 'B002PH1WB2', 'B01FR7S1KQ', 'B0013G36V0']",,VITAMINSEA,[],"40,840 in Grocery & Gourmet Food (",[],Grocery,,,$16.95,B018JJTYR8,"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Oj%2Bj9-sJL._SS40_.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51ht0HmnL0L._SS40_.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41ztKb14txL._SS40_.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/519K26giWTL._SS40_.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51chDuQ0DYL._SS40_.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51JJ%2BIvpbfL._SS40_.jpg']","['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Oj%2Bj9-sJL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51ht0HmnL0L.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41ztKb14txL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/519K26giWTL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51chDuQ0DYL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51JJ%2BIvpbfL.jpg']","{'\n    Product Dimensions: \n    ': '5 x 1 x 8 inches ; 4 ounces', 'Shipping Weight:': '3.2 ounces (', 'ASIN: ': 'B018JJTYR8', 'UPC:': '852377003456'}",Grocery & Gourmet FoodProduceFresh VegetablesSea Vegetables

Alaria is the most delicate of the brown seaweeds. It can be used to create a Miso soup with a wild, yet delicate flavor. Alaria, as with many sea vegetables, contains many of the vitamins and minerals needed to live a healthy life. Nutritional Values: Alaria (alaria esculenta) has one of the highest sources of calcium. It is rich in B complex vitamins, vitamins A, C, and K. High in protein , iron, magnesium, iodine, sodium, chromium, zinc, phosphorus, potassium, and dietary fiber. Alaria is almost identical to Japanese wakame biologically and nutritionally. Culinary Uses: Alaria is excellent for Miso soup and makes calcium rich vegetable soups, and stews. It imparts a chicken-like flavor when cooked with rice. Whole leaf alaria can be used uncooked in salads if pre-soaked, marinated in lemon juice, blanched or steamed. It can also be quick roasted and enjoyed as 'chips'. Alaria has more delicate taste but needs a longer cooking time (40 minutes) than the cultivated Japanese wakame (15 minutes). Soak prior to cooking and use the soaking water. Powdered Alaria is a great addition to any energy or protein drink that needs mineral fortification (particularly calcium)."", 'Statements regarding dietary supplements have not been evaluated by the FDA and are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease or health condition.']",,VitaminSea Organic Wakame Seaweed Alaria - 8 oz Whole Leaf Maine Coast - USDA &amp; Vegan Certified - Kosher - Perfect For Keto &amp; Paleo Diets - Sun Dried Raw Wild Atlantic Ocean Sea Vegetables (W WL8),"['B018KIJ9Z0', 'B018KIJ9YQ', 'B018RNDJ86', 'B01ELOUC30', 'B075WSS9P8', 'B005P0WOZE', 'B00IBNZAEE', 'B01ELNW4DM', 'B001AS975U', 'B001BKNFSC', 'B00D3ZDVO6', 'B0052BGLMS', 'B00I01ZXYE', 'B00FBSST9K', 'B000UWE0AO', 'B001KWD1BM', 'B01M1RM6YA', 'B001216DLG', 'B001BKTH70', 'B00LC01Z5G', 'B002HQSNCW', 'B0071GWMA2', 'B0096BR5O8', 'B004XIS14M', 'B07G6GD3M1', 'B01LXWXCBD', 'B001HTKNEQ', 'B00EHQEI6U', 'B008ZRYXAI', 'B001HTKNFA', 'B006H3BEL8', 'B00I33D544', 'B078SKL3SZ', 'B0019JRLC6', 'B00L9Z8YMG', 'B00NO9I6VO', 'B0019JTH82', 'B00HDLZ072', 'B076J4W9HR', 'B00013VAXM', 'B002FON43O', 'B002EUZEVY', 'B01GGWBIPG', 'B00028QCD4', 'B07DTDFGWH', 'B005763K40', 'B07G4LXPC7', 'B001AS886O', 'B078DDTSP8', 'B0013JRTQK', 'B01IC89JJ4', 'B0013JLOHA', 'B00B7CTDPS', 'B01HH79Y0U', 'B01N0I6ZGZ', 'B007A2XKPI', 'B07DNQTX22', 'B00856TSCC', 'B001PEWJWC', 'B0002YB40O', 'B00QKXVAN2', 'B002DY1EJC', 'B00PJ543H2', 'B01EM0NSIO', 'B001214Q1U', 'B00YQ2YNME', 'B079FFQVBF', 'B01BLYNWVM', 'B0039ITKR4', 'B079FDTZBP', 'B00060P9XM', 'B00KYWHCXW', 'B00PJ3IPMI', 'B00VVN02P8', 'B07F93F75W', 'B01N8PAXX3', 'B071CT2BLC', 'B0000CNU0C', 'B00EKRRVQ0', 'B0111LK0X8', 'B00PFI00PC', 'B0019JNRI8', 'B00SSC8ID8', 'B01M0ILFLB', 'B00TWUJQIG', 'B00IBNAW24', 'B01L2TGOEI', 'B0007SMLUM', 'B00CQ7K5QO', 'B072MK5TTK', 'B002PH1WB2', 'B01D5GA2IK', 'B0013G36V0']",,VITAMINSEA,[],"107,464 in Grocery & Gourmet Food (",[],Grocery,,,$28.95,B018RNDJB8,"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61QpyeVhLqL._SS40_.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41ztKb14txL._SS40_.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/519K26giWTL._SS40_.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/616K7X%2BvezL._SS40_.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/512xodhkYjL._SS40_.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51JJ%2BIvpbfL._SS40_.jpg']","['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61QpyeVhLqL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41ztKb14txL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/519K26giWTL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/616K7X%2BvezL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/512xodhkYjL.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51JJ%2BIvpbfL.jpg']","{'\n    Product Dimensions: \n    ': '5 x 2 x 8 inches ; 8 ounces', 'Shipping Weight:': '8.8 ounces (', 'ASIN: ': 'B018RNDJB8', 'UPC:': '024972501921'}",Grocery & Gourmet FoodProduceFresh VegetablesSea Vegetables

Logs are hand-cut and inoculated with shiitake mushroom spores in visible drill holes that are covered in cheese wax. Logs can be stood upright or laid horizontally for growing. Metal plaque on underside of log states date of inoculation. Just soak the log for 24 hours in cold water, mist it occasionally, and watch your crop emerge once the inoculation period is reached! . 12"" long, approx. 3""6"" diam. 47 lb. This strain features a fast spawn run, large, thick, first flush mushrooms with heavy yields! This is a great choice for a first time growers! How to Care for your Logs!  Choose a nice shady spot in your yard for your Mushroom log  When the spawn run is complete, the mycelium takes 6-12 Months from the inoculation date to start fruiting. When you can see fine white fibers (hyphae) running through the ends of the log they are ready for fruiting.  Once logs are removed from water Mushrooms should appear in 4-10 days.  You should be able to ""Force Fruit"" your log every 2 - 3 Months with these soaking. The monthly soaking keeps the moisture content high which the Mushroom Logs need to produce fruit!  Let the logs rest after each fruiting for 8 weeks. This resting period is for the mycelium to extract more nutrients from the log for more mushrooms. Harvest Time!  The mushrooms can be harvested at any time by taking a sharp blade and cutting them flush with the log at the base of the mushroom; however, it is best to harvest them just after the gills are exposed.

Alaria is the most delicate of the brown seaweeds. It can be used to create a Miso soup with a wild, yet delicate flavor. Alaria, as with many sea vegetables, contains many of the vitamins and minerals needed to live a healthy life. Nutritional Values: Alaria (alaria esculenta) has one of the highest sources of calcium. It is rich in B complex vitamins, vitamins A, C, and K. High in protein , iron, magnesium, iodine, sodium, chromium, zinc, phosphorus, potassium, and dietary fiber. Alaria is almost identical to Japanese wakame biologically and nutritionally. Culinary Uses: Alaria is excellent for Miso soup and makes calcium rich vegetable soups, and stews. It imparts a chicken-like flavor when cooked with rice. Whole leaf alaria can be used uncooked in salads if pre-soaked, marinated in lemon juice, blanched or steamed.

Mung beans have been enjoyed over centuries in many countries, especially in the Asian countries where they originated. Most people enjoy Mung beans because they are tasty and can be eaten with a combination of other foods such as rice and vegetables. The nutritional value of Mung beans is just amazing, not to mention their ability to help in weight loss, especially for those battling with their weight despite employing hard and difficult techniques that don't help them achieve their ideal weight. Apart from weight loss, Mung beans are very good cleansing supplements. You need it the most if you are frequently feeling tired, bloated and having irregular bowel movements. Other signs that show that your body is in need of thorough cleansing is the appearance of a thick white coating on your tongue. The pastiness of Mung beans is one the testimonies of their ability to help you detoxify your body system. This is because the presence of the soluble as well as the insoluble fiber in the beans literally helps scrape your colon sparkling clean. Another proof of their cleansing ability can be experienced when you place a teaspoon of uncooked Mung beans in your mouth and within a minute, you will experience a dry rough sensation on your tongue, a sensation commonly known as astringent in Ayurveda. This astringent sensation works hand in hand with the fiber to help tone your digestive organs in that the astringency quality aids in the production of mucus which aids in the movement of bowels as well as getting rid of toxins and parasites stuck in your gut. Mung beans are also crucial in restoring your bowels after undergoing food poisoning as their cooling nature helps reduce inflammation in your digestive tract.

I got just as much yield from the container as I did from a Raised Bed, but it was so much easier to harvest the Okinawan Sweet Potatoes in the container. It would take me a over an hour to dig up the Raised Bed and find all of the Japanese Sweet Potatoes. With the container, all I had to do was to dump the container onto some newspapers and the Okinawan Sweet Potatoes would just appear. No digging. No hunting. Start the Slips Sweet potatoes aren't started by seed like most other vegetables, they're started from slips. Slips are shoots that are grown from a mature sweet potato. To start your slips, you need several healthy, clean sweet potatoes. Each sweet potato can produce up to 50 slip sprouts. To create sprouts, carefully wash your potatoes and cut them either in half or in large sections. Place each section in a jar or glass of water with half of the potato below the water and half above. Use toothpicks to hold the potato in place (Image 1). The slips need warmth, so put them on a window ledge or on top of a radiator. In a few weeks your potatoes will be covered with leafy sprouts on top and roots on the bottom Before you plant sweet potato slips, you have a little extra work to do. Sweet potatoes need loose, well-drained soil to form large tubers. You don't want the roots to face resistance when they try to expand within the soil.

Shiitake mushrooms are delicious in everything from stir-fries and soups to pasta dishes and stews. Logs are hand-cut and inoculated with shiitake mushroom spores in visible drill holes that are covered in cheese wax. Logs can be stood upright or laid horizontally for growing. Metal plaque on underside of log states date of inoculation. Just soak the log for 24 hours in cold water, mist it occasionally, and watch your crop emerge once the inoculation period is reached! . 12"" long, approx. 2.5""5"" diam. 47 lb. This strain features a fast spawn run, large, thick, first flush mushrooms with heavy yields! This is a great choice for a first time growers! How to Care for your Logs!  Choose a nice shady spot in your yard for your Mushroom log  When the spawn run is complete, the mycelium takes 6-12 Months from the inoculation date to start fruiting. When you can see fine white fibers (hyphae) running through the ends of the log they are ready for fruiting.  Once logs are removed from water Mushrooms should appear in 4-10 days.  You should be able to ""Force Fruit"" your log every 2 - 3 Months with these soaking. The monthly soaking keeps the moisture content high which the Mushroom Logs need to produce fruit!  Let the logs rest after each fruiting for 8 weeks. This resting period is for the mycelium to extract more nutrients from the log for more mushrooms. Harvest Time!  The mushrooms can be harvested at any time by taking a sharp blade and cutting them flush with the log at the base of the mushroom; however, it is best to harvest them just after the gills are exposed.
